"""Execute every ``python`` code block in the prose docs.

The README and the docs site are full of runnable examples. This extracts each
fenced ``python`` block from those Markdown files and executes it, so an example
that references a renamed or non-existent API fails the test suite instead of
shipping.

Conventions for doc authors:
* Each ``python`` block must run on its own in a fresh namespace — import what
  it needs. Blocks do not share state.
* Keep them fast: small frames, few epochs. They run on every commit.
* A block that is deliberately illustrative / not meant to run can opt out with
  a marker comment: ``# docs-test: skip``.

For a specific failure, the test id names the file and the 1-based block index.
